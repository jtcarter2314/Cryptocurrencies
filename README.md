# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis
- The motive of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to help analyze the database with cryptocurrencies and to then create a report with cryptocurrencies that are classified by group by their features. You could use the classification report to be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
